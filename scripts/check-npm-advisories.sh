#
# Fail if the npm lockfile has a known advisory at or above a severity
# threshold, minus deliberate exceptions recorded with a stated reason.
#
# Scope
# -----
# The lockfile is audited with `--omit=dev`: what runs in the scheduled job is
# production dependencies, and dev-only advisories (test and lint tooling) tend
# to be unfixable transitive noise that gets ignored. The indexer decides what
# the app lists, so a compromised production dependency could publish anything
# — that is the failure this check exists for.
#
# Threshold
# ---------
# The default severity is "high" (fails on high and critical). Passing a
# different threshold is a deliberate, visible decision:
#
#   ./scripts/check-npm-advisories.sh moderate
#
# Anything below the threshold is reported in the audit output but does not
# fail the job.
#
# Exceptions
# ----------
# An advisory at or above the threshold can be recorded as a deliberate
# exception in .github/npm-audit-exceptions.json, keyed by advisory URL
# with the reason as the value:
#
#   {
#     "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx": "no fix upstream; affects only a dev flow"
#   }
#
# Every exception must carry a stated reason. A stale exception (one whose
# advisory is no longer present in the lockfile) is reported as a warning so
# it can be removed rather than accumulated.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/check-npm-advisories.sh [low|moderate|high|critical]
